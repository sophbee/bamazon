This week's homework reviewed our studies on using MySQL as well as NPM packages. For this assignment, I used:
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- NPM packages: inquirer and mysql

This application is reminiscient of Amazon: customers are able to see everything in the inventory, choose which items they would like to purchase, and find out the total amount for their order. If there aren't enough items in stock, the system will notify the customer and ask if he or she would like to purchase something else. I am using MySQL to keep track of the inventory numbers on the backend and JavaScript is updating those numbers as customers purchase items. Finally, I used Inquirer's validate option to make sure valid answers were entered by customers. All screenshots of the application in action have been added to the folder.
